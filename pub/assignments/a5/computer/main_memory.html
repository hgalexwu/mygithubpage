<p>The main memory of a computer refers to the random access memory or RAM for short. Every program a person executes open in this area of the computer. It is like the space one has on a desk. The bigger the desk, the more books you can open on it. Nowadays, computers commonly have at least 1 gigabyte of RAM.
