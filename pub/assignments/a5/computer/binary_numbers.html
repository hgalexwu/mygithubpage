<p>The binary number system is a couting system based on 2 digits. 0 and 1. Everytime you reach the last digit you go back and add the first digit. This is how you would count in binary: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000. This is basically 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. This system is used in computers and is the reason why bytes, bit and everything else is this way: 64 bit system, 1080 pi, etc.
