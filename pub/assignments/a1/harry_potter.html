	<p style="text-align:left;color:white;font-family:comic sans ms">Harry Potter found out he was a wizard on the night of his 13th birthday when Hagrid, the gates keeper of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, told him so.Harry would leave his aunt’s and uncle’s house, which he hated so dearly, for most of the year to attend Hogwarts. He didn’t know it at first, but he was the most famous wizard in the wizarding world because of the fact that he had not only survived but also defeated the most powerful dark wizard ever, Voldemort, when he was just a baby. What defines Harry over the years at Hogwarts was his courage, his good heart and everlasting will. These traits, along with his friends, helped him defeat Voldemort for good once again at the age of 19 when he was at full strength.</p>

		<p style="text-align:left;color:dodgerblue;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:20px"><u><b>Ron Weasley</b></u></p>

	<p style="text-align:left;color:white;font-family:comic sans ms">Ron Weasley comes from a family of wizards that have never mixed with muggles or in other words: non-magic people. He can be immediately spotted due to his red-ish orange hair. Contrary to Harry, Ron was born into a magical surrounding and therefore knew he was a wizard. As Harry was taking the train to Hogwarts for the first time, Ron asked if he could sit next to him because all the other cabins were full. From that day on, they became best friends until the very end.</p>

		<p style="text-align:left;color:gold;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:20px"><u><b>Hermione Granger</b></u></p>

	<p style="text-align:left;color:white;font-family:comic sans ms">Hermione Granger, unlike her two best friends, had two muggle parents who were both dentists. Ironically, she was the most educated one out of the trio and also the most prudent once at first. When faced with difficult situations and mind boggling traps and obstacles, the boys could always count on Hermione’s sharp mind to get them through their heartache.</p>
