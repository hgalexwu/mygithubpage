<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:16;color:midnightblue"><u><b>Past</u></b></p>

<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:14;color:midnightblue">I used to be king. Well...sort of...You see, when I first discovered this amazing thing called recess in primary and the fact that we were free in a big courtyard altogether, I was the happiest little kid alive. I would organize games of tag and we would all play together. Because I would play with so much heart and dedication, this pushed me to be at a higher physical level than my friends. I could run faster and for a longer period of time than anyone in my grade and the grade above. For this, I was crowned king by all who knew me in the world of tag.</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:16;color:midnightblue"><u><b>Present</u></b></p>

<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:14;color:midnightblue">The first time I ever touched a soccer ball was probably around the age of seven. I fell in love with the sport and was devoted to it fully. My acquired speed and endurance gave me an unprecedented advantage over my surrounding crowd. I continue to play this "joga bonito" until today. I am currently a second year striker of the Marianopolis soccer team and continue to practice with high intensity on my own time.</p> 

<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:16;color:midnightblue"><u><b>Future</u></b></p>

<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:14;color:midnightblue">I don't really know if I will have a future in soccer, but I like to hope so. In a few weeks, I will be trying out for the impact academy while I continue to practice alone and with the Demons. I was once offered contract to play in Dubai a few years ago but I forcefully turned it down because of my high school studies. If such an offer would be still available after cegep and/or university I would definitely take it into consideration. But until then, I will continue to enjoy the beautiful game.</p>
