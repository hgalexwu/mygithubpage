<h2 style="font-family:comic sans ms">Many years of practice and patients</h2>

<p style="font-family:comic sans ms">I was 3 years old when I first told my parents I wanted to play the piano. In pre-kindergarten, I would always end up playing the sticks because I would always be late to band practice even though I was assigned the triangle which was by far my favourite instrument at the time until I discovered the piano. My parents told me who could possibly teach a three year old to play and I replied with Miss Melanie, my band teacher who I had already asked to teach me how to play. I performed jingle bells only a few months later.</p>

<p style="font-family:comic sans ms">I continued my studies with a different teacher at the age of five until I finally got my Collegial II degree from the McGill Conservatory of Music at the age of fourteen. After that, I performed at a few fundraising events and continued to play to this day. I now have 6 students which I try to transfer my knowledge to, with great pleasure.</p> 

<p style="font-family:comic sans ms">I still do practice when I can and please my parents with some lovely music while they eat. My favourite genre of classical music is pieces from the romantic era which leads to my favourite composer being Frederick Chopin.  I also greatly enjoy bands such as Coldplay, U2, Linkin Park, ACDC, Bastille and Element.</p>
