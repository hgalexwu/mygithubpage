Hovhannes Aivazian, or more commonly known as, Ivan Aivazovsky was an Armenian painter who was famous for his works regarding waves.
More than half of his paintings were of this theme. What led him to brilliantly paint these forces of nature was the fact that he had spent a great chunk of his like at sea, and therefore had so many memories and crystal clear visions of waves. His most famous work is the ninth wave which can be seen in the art page. His works are displayed in many museums which include, The National Art Gallery of Armenia, State Russian Museum in St. Petersbourg(a.k.a. Leningrad) and Dolmabache Palace.</p>
