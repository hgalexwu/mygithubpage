<p style="text-align:left;color:midnightblue;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:20">Tha Balian family was a dynasty of very famous Armenian architects who worked for the Ottoman empire's Sultans. For five generations, between the 18th and 19th centuries, they designed and constructed magnificent buildings for the empire. They even named some of the palaces with Armenian names. Dolmabache, which is the most famous creation of the family, comes from the words "Dolma" and "Bakhche" which respectively mean a famous Armenian dish and garden.</p>
