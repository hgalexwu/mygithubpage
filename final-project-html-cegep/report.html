			Final Project involving a Magic Square and a Tic Tac Toe Game using HTML

		<h3>Magic Square</h3>
		<p>This game consists of a 3 by 3 table. The goal is to obtain the number 15 when summing all the numbers horizontally, vertically or diagonally. In each square the player can chose any number between 1 and 9.</p> 
		<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
		<p>This game consists of each player choosing to put either an X or an O in the square by taking turns. First one to have 3 horizontally, diagonally or vertically, wins!</p>

		<h3>Our thoughts!</h3>
		<p>We decided to choose Notepad++ after reading multiple reviews, as our HTML editor of choice. This editor is a very simple resource that can edit a plethora of coding languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, etc. However, it is not in any ways a guide on how to create codes.  This program doesn't teach you how to create a website, thus, one must have knowledge on the subject in order to use it. To start this software, one must double-click on the executable and it simply opens up. Then you use it as if it was notepad. It is important to remember to save it as a hypertext markup language file, not as a .txt file.</p>
		
		<br><br>
		<u><b>Magic Square Steps</u></b>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>First of all, to create a magic square, you need to start establishing the content of your page. In other words, one must create an html index file and insert frames. The frames must be set into 3 major parts: the top, the square, which is the middle, and the bottom. The square's height will be bigger than the top and the bottom frames. In addition, the middle must be another set of frames in which there are 9 frames of the same sizes which creates a 3x3 table. 
		</p>
		
		
	<p>Second of all, each frame must redirect to a certain html file. The top one must contain the name of the game. All the frames in the middle section will be discussed later on. The bottom one must contain a table where there are 3 links. It is important to use "target=_top" in each link because it will act as a link from a frame that will open the entire page, instead of just opening in the frame where the link is situated. One link is to restart the game, a link to the first index file. Another one is a solution, which will redirect the page to a solutions html file that is the same as the index file, however, each box in the middle section will have a number. Finally, the return to the home page link simply redirects you to the home page.</p>
		

		
	<p>Third of all, the most important aspect of the magic square is the magic square itself. In fact, each frame of this 3x3 frame contains the same things, only the title changes. Each frame consists of one table of width 100% that is 3x3. So there are 3 columns and 3 rows. Each table data are equal in sizes and contains an image acting as a link to the big size format of the image you just clicked. This big size image is also a link back to the previous table containing the 9 images. By the way, the 9 images in the 3x3 tables are images of the numbers 1 to 9.</p> 
	

		
	<p>Fourth of all, there is an external style sheet used to center the data in the tables, align header 1 and to increase the font size to 20 for the tables containing class=turtle.</p>
		<br><br>
		
	<u><b>Tic Tac Toe</u></b>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>The first thing you need to do is to separate a page into 3 rows using a frameset. The first row will consist of 1 frame that links to "banner.html". This will be the banner which will contain the title and the instructions of the game.  The second row will contain 3 columns. The first and third one, (side.html) will be a webpage of the same background color as banner and bottom and will contain no text.</p>

	 
	<p>The second column is a 3 by 3 frameset of its own where each frame links to a webpage called "frame.html".</p>

	<p>The bottom frame will consist of a webpage that contains a 2 row-1column table which contains two links: one that restarts the game by redirecting the page to its original state and one that redirects the user to the homepage (use "target=_top" in the anchor for these links). </p>
	
	<p>Frame.html is the webpage that will contain the option to click on the red or blue square. This webpage will contain a 1 row-3 column table. The first and third cells will contain images of a red and blue square that are links to red.html and blue.html. The second cell will simply contain nothing and serves to separate the cells.</p>
	
	<p>Red.html and blue.html are webpages that have either a red background color or blue background color and contain images of the red or blue squares. The images should be links to frame.html. No target is required because by default it will open the webpage in the opened frame. </p>
	
	<p>Be sure to center all the images and remove any unwanted borders from the frames and the tables. For maximum efficiency, the table of frame.html should contain cells with width and height of 100%. It is also a good idea to appropriately name your frames, give titles to your images and alternatives in case they fail to load.You can divide the framesets and frames however you see fit but I recommend the following for rows: 15% 70% 15%, as for the columns: 30% 40% 30%.</p>
	<br>
	<u><b>Pros</u></b>
	<br>
	<p>To start off, Notepad++ is designed in a very simplistic, user-friendly manner. In fact, it is basically the same as notepad, however, there is a color coding to help you organize your code in a proper form while highlighting attributes, values, etc. with different colors. This is very helpful in order to avoid accidental mistakes such as forgetting to close a paragraph. Also, there is the word wrap feature that is very helpful to helps fit all the codes on your computer screen without having to scroll. In addition, the most important feature in our opinion is the fact that the program has its own spell checker. It red underlines a mistake just like Microsoft word.  Another great tool is the function of having a quick browser launcher directly from Notepad ++ to see how your coding looks on a web browser. It also contains line numbers and code collapsing. It is very easy to move codes around as well. All that is needed is to select it and drag it. Even with all these functions, the program still runs very smoothly and quickly without any bugs. Notepad ++ is also capable of opening files that open in another program (unlike Textpad).</p>
	<br>
	<u><b>Cons</u></b>
	<br>
	<p>It is very hard to find flaws in such a great program, however, nothing is perfect.	 In spite of all its perks, Notepad++ does not contain a built in browser.   This software does not have an auto-complete feature which would automatically close tags. Notepad++ cannot deal with languages from right to left however this disadvantage did not affect our work. Besides these minor details, Notepad ++ is a great software for HTML coding and we highly recommend it!</p>
